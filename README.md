# Korean-drama-recommender
I love watching Korean Dramas so I wanted to see if I could make my own recommender. I took the categories from the dataset I thought were most interesting and did some EDA on them and then used ML to create the recommender.

This is my first personal project and the first finished draft of it. There are still things I need to update on it like the outcomes and comments of each line of code and to make the charts nicer. Planning on updating it every other day or so.

I used the dataset from here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahbab911/top-250-korean-dramas-kdrama-dataset by AHBAB HOSSAIN.
